		If you want these relationships to be created automatically in your DTO classes, then the FKs have to be set up
		in the <relationships> section of this file. You can run the type "RelationshipsConfig" with NoefGen.exe to automatically
		generate the text you should put in the <relationships> section of this config file (you'll have to hand edit it to clean it up
		afterwards, renaming things appropriately, etc). Note that when running the RelationshipsConfig type, the output is simply
		sent to stdout. It's usually not ran from a batch file, but manually from the command line, since you only use it when
		hand editing this file.
